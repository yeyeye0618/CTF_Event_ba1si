Ghostccamm gave 24 monkes 4,200 cans of energy drinks and locked them in a basement to develop a *secure file sharing platform*.

After 3 days with no sleep, the monkes built this website. However, they are very **cross** for some reason.

To access the bot add `-bot` at the end of your challenge instance domain.

**Important!** When exploiting the challenge instance, use your instance hostname **not http://monkestorage:3000**!
