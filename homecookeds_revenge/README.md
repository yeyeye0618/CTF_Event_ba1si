Homecooked is a ASGI-compliant web framework similar to Flask and FastAPI. It includes
support for dynamic routing of paths and middleware, and also features a static server.
Through PyDantic, Homecooked is able to deserialize JSON requests to Python objects and
via the Meal Template Engine, Homecooked supports it's own, very special, templating language.
It also has support for SubRouters, which is Homecooked's equivalent to Blueprints in Flask.

Meal consists entirely of emojis and literals, and well as user-defined variables (which can 
be emojis). See homecooked/meal/meal.lark for grammar reference
